Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last May, don't know the exact day
In my hand, there was a ring
Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

(Yes I will)
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
'Til my humble life has ended
And time begins again, couldn't we be

Couldn't we be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long (our love will grow so strong)
Couldn't we be happily ever after? (Couldn't we be, baby?)
Leaving you never 'til forever's gone

When I was away, mm-mm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
And so many times, I pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, ooh

(Yes, I will)
Take you for my wife
The center of my life
And I will never ever fade
From this choice I've made, ooh, oh-yeah, yeah-yeah

Couldn't we be happily ever after? (Come on)
We could be strong together for so long (said my love is strong)
Couldn't we be happily ever after? (Couldn't we please, babe?)
Leaving you never 'til forever's gone (no, no, said, hey-yeah)

You don't have to look no further than me
Don't look no more, baby, yeah
You don't need much more than my loving to make you happy
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, babe
Beneath the sight of God
I would make this vow to you, so come on, baby
I'll be right here, stay with me
Said I'll be here, baby, hey

Couldn't we be happily ever after? (I said I wanna be, I said I wanna be)
We could be strong together for so long (oh, oh, I love you so much, my babe)
Couldn't we be happily ever after? (Couldn't we please, baby?)
Leaving you never 'til forever's gone (said no, no, said no, no)
(I will never leave you)

Couldn't we be happily ever after? (See today, I wanna make you my wife)
We could be strong together for so long (I wanna spend all of my life)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) couldn't we be happily ever after?
(I won't ever leave) leaving you never 'til forever's gone (I'll never go nowhere)
(Oh no, never hurt you)
