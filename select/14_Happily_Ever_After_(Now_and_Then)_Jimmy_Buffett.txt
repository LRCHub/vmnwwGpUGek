I've been a stand-in, a stunt-man
I've taken some falls, troubles, I've had my share
But one has to learn how to run before walkin'
'Round breathin' that million air

Take it from me 'cuz I've found
If you leave it then somebody else is bound
To find that treasure, that moment of pleasure
When yours, it could have been

Some people never find it
Some only pretend but me
I just want to live happily ever after
Every now and then

I've been in vans and in bands
On and through stages, one thing I can conclude
One has to learn havin' fun is just smilin' through
Those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes

Take it from me 'cuz I've found
If you leave it then somebody else is bound
To find that treasure, that moment of pleasure
When yours, it could have been

Some people never find it
Some only pretend but me
I just want to live happily ever after
Every now and then

Some people never find it
Some only pretend but me
Hell, I just want to live happily ever after
Every now and then

Every now and then
Every now and then
Happily ever after

Every now and then
Every now and then
Happily ever after
