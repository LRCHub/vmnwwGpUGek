Once upon a time, a prince asked a beautiful
Princess "Will you marry me?" The princess
Said no, and the prince lived happily ever after.
And he rode motorcycles and fucked skinny,
Big-titted broads, and hunted and fished
Whenever the fuck he wanted, and went to
Naked bars, and dated women half his age, and
Drank whiskey, beer, Captain Morgan, and
Snorted cocaine off strippers' asses, and never
Heard bitching, and never paid child support or
Alimony. And ate pussies and ass-fucked
Cheerleaders and kept his house and guns, and
Never got cheated on while he was at work, and
All his friends and family thought he was
Fucking cool as hell, and he had tons of money
In the bank, and he left the toilet seat up

The End
