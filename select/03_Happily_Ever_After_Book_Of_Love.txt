You made me feel happy
But only for a minute
Now I'm over you
I count the times you've made me sad
The things you put me through

Happily ever after
I'm over you
Happily ever after
I'm over you

I'm looking at my best friend
Who's staring out the window
Wondering what's on his mind
I wonder if he's as happily ever after
As I

I count the tears
You've made me cry
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12

Happily ever after
I'm over you
Happily ever after
And now I'm over you

Happily ever after

Now when I go out
And see you around
I don't care what you do
The pain and the anger has all vanished
Now so have you

And now I count
The tears of joy
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12

Happily ever after
I'm over you
Happily ever after
And now I'm over you

Happily, happily, happily, happily ever after
Happily, happily, happily, happily ever after

Happily ever after
I'm over you
Happily ever after

I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you
Over you

Happily ever after
Happily ever after
